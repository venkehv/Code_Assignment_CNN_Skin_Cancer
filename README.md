#  CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma
Build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 


## Solution 
Created a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma using Augmentor to fix class imbalance


## Conclusions

Final Model has Training accuracy of 96.7% and validation accuracy of 81%.
The Model is able to predict images correctly for 81% of unseen data is very good characteristic of the model where it is neither overfit nor underfit.
The Augmentor to balance the classes did help to improve the validation accuracy to 81% from 56%
